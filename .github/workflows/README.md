# Automatic hexlet

After completing all the steps in the project, automatic hexlet will become available to you. Tests are run on each commit - once all tasks in the Hexlet interface are completed, make a commit, and the hexlet will run automatically.

The hexlet-check.yml file is responsible for running these hexlet - do not delete this file, edit it, or rename the repository.
